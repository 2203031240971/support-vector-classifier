🧠 Support Vector Classifier (SVC) - Machine Learning Project
🚀 This project is a simple yet effective of the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) using Python and the scikit-learn library.
📌 The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is a powerful supervised learning model used for classification tasks.
🧪 In this project, I demonstrate how SVC can be used to train a model on a labeled dataset and accurately classify new data.
📊 The dataset used here is clean and suitable for binary or multi-class classification problems.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:
Python 🐍
scikit-learn 📚
NumPy 🔢
Matplotlib 📈
Jupyter Notebook 📓

🔎 The project follows standard steps in a Machine Learning pipeline:
Data loading and preprocessing
Splitting into training and test sets
Model training using SVC
Accuracy and evaluation metrics
Plotting the decision boundary (if 2D data)

📈 The model provides insights into how well SVC separates the classes and performs under different kernel options (linear, RBF, etc.).
📁 This is a beginner-friendly implementation and is great for those learning ML fundamentals.
💡 Future enhancements may include hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and testing on real-world datasets.
✅ This repository is perfect for students, beginners, or anyone looking to understand how Support Vector Classifiers work.
